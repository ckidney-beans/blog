## A Fresh Take

Welcome, to whatever this is.  I am still trying to decide that.  Trying to decide things is a theme in my life right now.  I am trying to decide where I belong.

For those who have known me, I have had many interests and hobbies in my life.  I am not going to list them now.  My issue with that is I have never had a clear focus in life.  I have never been one of those kids or adults that knew what they wanted to do, where they wanted to go.  I just existed, I lived, and let life guide me more than me guiding my life.

Now I'm middle aged and I have come to the conclusion that I am lost and there is no trail of bread crumbs for me to follow and find my way back.  I am left with moving forward, but this time with some effort in making a true purpose for myself.  

I have accepted that I am not one of those people with their born passion.  To even think that I am going to be able to focus on only one thing would be unrealistic.  Maybe as I continue to wrestle control of my mind back from ADHD, I will be able to become more focused, but for now I don't want to limit nor bore myself.

This leads me topic of this site.  I guess a good first place to start would be the name, Pit Lane Commentary.  This is a reference to my current love of [[motorsport\|motorsport]], but mainly [[Formula 1\|Formula 1]].  I have become a true fan of Formula 1 over the years, and wanted to have this reflected in the title of portion of the internet that I am craving out.  

I would note that although I have picked this as the title for this site, it is not what I see as the main topic.  I see this area as a place to detail my growing interest in [[Homelab\|Homelab]], [[3D Printing\|3D Printing]], and [[Ethical Hacking\|Ethical Hacking]].  This are all topics that I how to document as I learn and grow in this new fields of interest.

I would welcome you to read along on my journey into these topics.  As I continue to learn, I hope to also work on some development of this page, which is pretty basic in its current form.  I am looking forward to this renewed energy and hope that you enjoy the glimpse into my learning experience.
